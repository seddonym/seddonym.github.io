It's easy to build sites in Django without thinking much about database transactions.
This can be perilous. In this talk I explore in depth the concepts of atomicity and concurrency,
and how to handle them using Django.

This is a longer, more detailed version of [a talk I gave at Pycon 2017]({% link _talks/2017-10-28-database-concurrency.html %}).
