As a Django project grows in size and complexity, it can be difficult to prevent it turning into an architectural
'Big Ball of Mud'. The 'Rocky River' pattern helps you avoid this.

This talk was filmed at the London Django Meetup, but unfortunately the video is no longer available. But you can read
about the pattern [in my blog post instead]({% link _posts/2018-09-16-rocky-river-pattern.md %}).
