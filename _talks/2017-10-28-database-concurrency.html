It's easy to forget that your Django site may end up accessing the database several times at once. This can be perilous!

In this talk, I explore Django's concurrency handling in detail. You'll learn key concepts, common pitfalls
and gain a solid foundation in how to write code that is concurrency-safe. This talk has plenty of tips that
are relevant to all Python developers that work with databases.
